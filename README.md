**Brain games project**  is Python project that contains a set of 5 simple math games:
+ **brain-even** *where u have to guess if the number is even*
+ **brain-calc** *where you have to give an answer to a simple mathematical expression*
+ **brain-gcd** *where you have to guess the greatest common divisor of given numbers*
+ **brain-progression** *where u have to where you have to guess the missing element of the arithmetic progression*
+ **brain-prime** *where u have to guess if number is prime*


To install games, after downloading the repository, go to the main directory of the project and type in the terminal:
`python3 -m pip install --user dist/*.whl`,
after which you can start the game you are interested in by typing its name.
